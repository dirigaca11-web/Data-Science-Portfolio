I designed and trained a ResNet50-based computer vision model to predict age from facial images, using ImageDataGenerator for data preprocessing and augmentation, optimizing performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and the Adam learning rate, achieving a final MAE of less than 8 years.


The file with the images could not be uploaded due to its excessive size.
